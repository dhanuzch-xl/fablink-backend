In the provided reference code, the following key steps are involved in the **bend analysis**:

1. **Bend Detection Logic:**
   - The reference code uses a node-based approach to handle faces and bends.
   - It uses `Simple_node` objects for representing each face and its bend characteristics.
   - The code relies on detecting "counter-faces" by comparing distances between faces and checking their relative positions and angles.
   - It calculates the **bend angle** and **k-factor** based on face geometry and material properties like thickness.

2. **Counter-Face Calculation:**
   - Faces are compared using their middle points (centroids) to find adjacent or counter faces.
   - If the distance between face centroids is within a certain tolerance (based on thickness), the faces are considered to be adjacent, forming a bend.
   - Counter-face detection is crucial to identifying which faces are part of the same bend.

3. **Bend Direction and K-Factor:**
   - The bend direction (up or down) is determined based on the surface curvature or face orientation.
   - The K-factor is calculated based on the bend angle and material thickness, which helps determine the correct unfolding transformation.
   - The K-factor also influences the translation length during the unfolding process.

4. **Unfolding Faces:**
   - Each bend node calculates its transformation (rotation, translation) relative to its parent node.
   - Unfolding transforms bend nodes into flat faces by applying these transformations recursively.

To align your **bend analysis** with the reference code:

- You need to introduce **node-based structure** where each face and its bend properties are stored in a `Simple_node`-like structure.
- Implement **counter-face detection** based on centroid distance and orientation, like in the reference code.
- Incorporate **K-factor calculations** based on the material thickness and bend angle.
- Use these properties to perform **unfolding transformations** by iterating over nodes and applying the calculated rotations and translations.

### Next Steps:

1. **Enhance `bend_analysis.py`:**
   - Add the logic for detecting counter-faces, calculating bend angles, and assigning K-factors.
   - Ensure the code identifies whether a face is flat or part of a bend.

2. **Create a `Simple_node` class:**
   - Store information about each face, including its parent and children, bend direction, and transformation parameters.
   - Implement methods for calculating the K-factor, bend angle, and unfolding transformations.

3. **Test the Bend Analysis:**
   - Create unit tests to check whether bends are detected, angles calculated, and unfolding performed correctly.

4. **Test Code Example:**
```python
def test_bend_analysis():
    # Load a STEP file
    file_path = "data/WP-2.step"
    shape = load_step_file(file_path)

    # Extract faces
    faces = extract_faces(shape)

    # Perform bend detection
    thickness = 2.0
    bends = detect_bends(faces, thickness)

    assert len(bends) > 0, "No bends were detected."
    print(f"Detected {len(bends)} bends successfully!")
    
    # Validate bend properties (angles, k-factors)
    for bend in bends:
        print(f"Bend angle: {bend.bend_angle}, K-factor: {bend.k_factor}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_bend_analysis()
```

Let me know if you'd like me to proceed with the full integration of the `Simple_node` and related features.    



### Bend Analysis
Enhance the Bend Detection:

    Refine the detection logic to include surface type checks and not rely solely on proximity and thickness. Add functionality to handle edge properties, particularly for more complex bends like those involving cylindrical faces.
    Implement checks for sheet edges and manage nodes accordingly.

Integrate with the Node-Based Structure:

    Introduce a class-based structure, similar to Simple_node in the reference code, to track nodes (bends) and their relationships (children, parents, edges). This will allow you to process more complex unfolding scenarios, where multiple bends are involved.

Unfolding Transformation Enhancements:

    Improve the unfold_bend function to incorporate both rotations and translations, ensuring that the faces maintain correct relative positioning after unfolding.

Include Advanced Features:

    Implement features like k-factor adjustment, handling of edge cases (e.g., seams, welded edges), and edge splitting during unfolding, similar to the reference implementation.

### **Explanation of Each Folder:**

1. **/src (Source Code)**:
   - **main.py**: The main script to run the unfolding workflow. You can start by developing functions incrementally and call them here.
   - **file_loader.py**: Responsible for loading the STEP file and extracting geometric information (e.g., faces, edges).
   - **sheet_tree.py**: Manages the tree structure (`SheetTree` class) and node operations. This will handle the recursive traversal and face processing.
   - **face_operations.py**: Contains functions to perform face transformations (rotations, translations) and geometric calculations.
   - **bend_analysis.py**: Contains the logic for detecting bends, calculating bend angles, and applying unfolding transformations.

   - Start with simple files and add more complex ones as your project progresses.

4. **/scripts (Helper Scripts)**:
   - **run_tests.sh**: A script to execute all the tests using `pytest` or another testing framework. You can use this to quickly verify that everything is working.
   - **run_unfold_example.py**: This script could run a specific example using the source code to test the overall functionality (loading, unfolding, exporting).

5. **README.md**:
   - Document the project, explaining the purpose, how to run the code, and any setup instructions.
   - Include details for testing and contributing to the project.

6. **requirements.txt**:
   - List all the dependencies (e.g., PythonOCC, pytest, numpy, etc.) required to run the project.

7. **.gitignore**:
   - If you're using Git, this file will ensure that irrelevant files (e.g., temporary files, build artifacts) are not committed to version control.

     - Load a STEP file.
     - Build the face tree.
     - Perform bend analysis and transformations.
     - Export the unfolded part.
   - Run integration tests using **/scripts/run_unfold_example.py** to test the end-to-end process.



Refactoring plan

### **Refactoring and Test Planning:**

Given the current code structure and your project goals, we can refactor and integrate the functionality across all modules efficiently while preparing for comprehensive tests. Here's an analysis and a step-by-step integration plan based on the files you have provided:

---

### **1. Refactor `sheet_tree.py` to integrate with `bend_analysis.py` and `face_operations.py`:**

**Current Code**:
- The `sheet_tree.py` is responsible for building the tree structure of faces and managing the relationships between connected faces.
- `face_operations.py` provides methods for transforming and extracting faces.
- `bend_analysis.py` detects bends and calculates bend angles.

**Changes**:
- Use the `BendNode` from `face_operations.py` across the project for consistent node representation.
- Call the `detect_bends()` function from `bend_analysis.py` after the tree is constructed to ensure bend detection is uniform across the project.
- Calculate bend angles for the tree's connected nodes using `calculate_bend_angle()`.

**Refactor Plan**:
1. **Import necessary modules**:
    - From `bend_analysis.py`: `detect_bends()` and `calculate_bend_angle()`.
    - From `face_operations.py`: `extract_faces()` and other utility functions.

2. **Build tree and perform bend analysis**:
    - After constructing the face hierarchy in `sheet_tree.py`, call `detect_bends()` to identify all bends.
    - For every identified bend, calculate the bend angle and attach it to the respective nodes.

---

### **2. Refactor `bend_analysis.py` to work with `sheet_tree.py`:**

**Current Code**:
- The `BendNode` is defined here, but we need to centralize it in one place (perhaps in `face_operations.py`).
- The core logic of detecting bends is correct but needs to be integrated with the tree structure.

**Refactor Plan**:
1. **Centralize `BendNode`**: Move `BendNode` to `face_operations.py` to avoid code duplication.
2. **Enhance `detect_bends()`**:
    - When `detect_bends()` is called in `sheet_tree.py`, pass the tree’s faces and detect all bends between connected faces.

---

### **3. Refactor `face_operations.py`**:

**Current Code**:
- The core functionality for extracting faces, performing transformations, and analyzing surfaces is well defined.

**Refactor Plan**:
1. **Move `BendNode` here**: As mentioned earlier, centralize the `BendNode` class here.
2. **Enhance modularity**:
    - Ensure that functions like `extract_faces()` are used in `sheet_tree.py` and are also independently testable.

---

### **4. Ensure `file_loader.py` loads STEP files properly**:

**Current Code**:
- The `load_step_file()` function reads a STEP file and returns a `TopoDS_Shape`. This is used in the workflow's entry point (`main.py`).

**Refactor Plan**:
1. **No major changes needed**: This file is performing its task well. Just ensure that the tests in `test_file_loader.py` validate its functionality effectively.

---

### **5. Full Workflow in `main.py`**:

**Current Code**:
- The `process_unfold()` function is the workflow’s main entry point, where STEP files are processed, unfolded, and exported.

**Refactor Plan**:
1. **Unfolding workflow**:
    - Ensure the `sheet_tree.py` builds the tree, performs the bend analysis, and manages relationships between the faces.
    - Use the results from the bend analysis to generate the unfolded shape and export it.

---

### **6. Write Comprehensive Tests**:

Now that the core functionality has been refactored, write unit and integration tests across all modules:

#### **Unit Tests**:
1. **Test `file_loader.py`**:
    - Verify that `load_step_file()` correctly loads STEP files.

2. **Test `face_operations.py`**:
    - Test face extraction, transformations (rotation and translation), and thickness filtering independently.

3. **Test `bend_analysis.py`**:
    - Test `detect_bends()` and `calculate_bend_angle()` using mock faces.

4. **Test `sheet_tree.py`**:
    - Test tree creation and parent-child relationships between faces.
    - Verify that bends are detected and properly linked to nodes.

#### **Integration Tests**:
1. **Full Workflow**:
    - Simulate the full process: Load a STEP file, build the tree, detect bends, calculate angles, unfold, and export.

2. **Use Sample Files**:
    - Use the provided STEP files (e.g., `example_1.step`) to validate the entire workflow.

---

### **Conclusion**:

By integrating the existing functionality and properly refactoring the code across modules, we ensure that the development stays modular, maintainable, and testable. Now, you can move forward with writing the tests as outlined, ensuring that the entire sheet metal unfolding process is well-validated.
