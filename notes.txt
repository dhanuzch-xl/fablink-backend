Task explanation

This DXF likely represents a sheet metal component with a defined 
outer profile (represented by the LWPOLYLINE on the OUTER_PROFILES layer), 
multiple circular holes or cutouts (represented by the CIRCLE entities on the 
INTERIOR_PROFILES layer), and bend instructions (represented by the LINE 
entities on the BEND and BEND_EXTENT layers). The combination of these elements 
suggests a flat sheet metal part designed to be folded into a 3D shape, 
likely a box or enclosure with punched holes.



dxf2threed code explanation
Extracting the Outer Profile:

The outer profile is extracted from the LWPOLYLINE entities in the OUTER_PROFILES layer.
We create edges for each segment of the polyline and then form a closed wire from these edges.
Handling Circles (Interior Holes):

Circles from the INTERIOR_PROFILES layer are stored as centers and radii.
These circles are extruded and subtracted from the solid shape to form holes.
Extruding the Profile:

The outer profile is extruded along the Z-axis to create a 3D shape.
Cutting Holes:

Each circle is extruded and subtracted from the 3D shape to create the circular holes.
Displaying the 3D Shape:

The final 3D shape, with the outer profile and cutouts, is displayed using the OCC.Display.SimpleGui.init_display() function.
